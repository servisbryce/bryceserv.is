# Why should I bother using a socket library?
A socket library reduces your program's design complexity, allowing you to focus on what's important instead of writing mostly boilerplate socket code. Furthermore, writing and implementing your socket code is complex and intensive, leaving plenty of room for error or security risks.

Furthermore, you must also implement Transport Layer Security overtop of your application, doubling the complexity as now you must rewrite your code for OpenSSL.

## What makes your socket library different?
My socket library provides nearly everything you need to get a reliable, performant, and secure socket server up and running within seconds. Any code that is repetitious is functionized and automated for the best development experience possible. 

Furthermore, my socket library makes use of a thread pool that uses my own stepwise algorithm to automatically scale whenever necessary.

# The developer experience.
My server socket library provides an excellent foundation that is able to be started in just seconds with little to no effort. Fill out the parameters structure, pass it to the context generator, write a payload function, and then listen using that context and pass it the payload function. As soon as a user connects, the server handles the negotiations, your payload function is executed, and then the server closes the connection automatically.

# My plans for the future.
From my ventures in this project, I learned about thread pools which has inspired me to create my own scalable performant thread pool framework.
