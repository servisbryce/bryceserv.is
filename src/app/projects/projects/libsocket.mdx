# Why should I bother using a socket library?
A socket library reduces your program's design complexity, allowing you to focus on what's important instead of writing mostly boilerplate socket code. Furthermore, writing and implementing your socket code is complex and intensive, leaving plenty of room for error or security risks.

Furthermore, you must also implement Transport Layer Security overtop of your application, doubling the complexity as now you must rewrite your code for OpenSSL.
