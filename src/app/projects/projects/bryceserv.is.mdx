# Design Criteria
I wanted a personal website that could act as my blog, project portfolio, and biography and be flexible to customize and expand later.

I didn't want to reinvent the wheel either, and I didn't want to spend days getting my site up and running. Therefore, I needed to use an excellent template and fork it to customize it.

# The Framework
At first, I wanted to use Nuxt. Still, I encountered considerable issues that made the development experience painful and slowâ€”from my personal experience, trying to use design systems like Preline was like pulling teeth.

Eventually, I landed on Nuxt's neighbor, Next.js, and I immediately fell in love with its simplicity, superb developer experience, and broad support. Furthermore, Next.js was natively supported by Vercel which made deploying my application a breeze.

# The Template
Once I had decided on the framework I'd be using; I needed to find a flexible template that didn't require me to reinvent the wheel. 

After browsing GitHub, I landed on Magic Portfolio powered by Once UI. The design of Magic Portfolio was perfect, simple, and easy to modify to my liking.

# The Fork
I immediately got to work and forked Magic Portfolio. I made several changes, such as renaming tabs to make them more appropriate, trimming down some parts I didn't need, like password-protected routes, and writing a few project posts (including the one you're reading right now).


I plan to implement significant additions to modify the website's design and style. Specifically, I wish to alter the navigation bar to make it larger and a glassy blur. I also want to write more project posts on GitHub for all my finished projects.

# Vercel
Vercel made deploying my website a dream. Previously, I used a virtual private server to host my applications; however, it was clunky and generally slower than I wanted.

Thankfully, Vercel exists. Vercel is a fantastic platform that allows you to deploy your application almost straight from your GitHub account. Push to central, and Vercel will take care of the rest by building and deploying your web application.

I also migrated over from Cloudflare to Vercel for my proxy solution.
