# Should I trust code generated by artificial intelligence?
Absolutely not, because artificial intelligence doesn't have the reasoning capabilities that you do. On numerous occasions, when I've experimented with artificial intelligence to see its programming capabilities, it often shipped broken, nonsensical code full of vulnerabilities and depreciated functions. You should treat all code generated by artificial intelligence as untrusted and unsafe.

You should always avoid copying code from artificial intelligence and throwing it directly into your program unless you're certain precisely what it's doing and why it's there.

# What should I use artificial intelligence for?
Artificial intelligence is exemplary at finding and recognizing patterns in data. This trait makes it incredibly good for debugging programs because it can match debugging data with its immense dataset and determine what might have happened. For example, I once encountered an extremely vague OpenSSL error, and there weren't any results on Google for it, so I couldn't figure it out and was stumped. However, when I asked artificial intelligence what the error may be caused, it provided an excellent synopsis that cleared up the vague error message and allowed me to patch the bug.

# What shouldn't I use artificial intelligence for?
Do not use artificial intelligence mindlessly. You must understand precisely what it's doing and saying because artificial intelligence cannot tell if it's saying is correct or not. Even though artificial intelligence is trained on massive datasets, you are still more intelligent than it because you can discern what is proper and what is false. You shouldn't use artificial intelligence for tasks you don't understand yourself. Instead, you should teach yourself the topic and learn it, then use artificial intelligence later as an assistant and not an expert. You should become an expert and use artificial intelligence to automate tasks that waste your time, then audit what the artificial intelligence outputs and make corrections.

In short, you shouldn't rely on artificial intelligence to be an expert for you; instead, you should use it like an assistant. You should become the expert and audit, modify, and adjust whatever outputs are spewed from the artificial intelligence model.
