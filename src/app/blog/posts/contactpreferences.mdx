# What's your email?
I am always available through email, and I regularly check it. You may reach me at ```bryceservis@bryceserv.is```, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

## What if I need to disclose sensitive information to you?
If you wish to sign or encrypt your email to me, please click the key icon at the footer of this webpage to download my Pretty Good Privacy public key, which has the fingerprint ```907873A1```.

However, if your message isn't important or has sensitive information, I don't recommend signing or encrypting it as it wastes both of our time.

# Where else can I reach you?
You may contact me through LinkedIn if you wish.

I don't give out contact details like phone numbers or ways to contact me on instant messengers unless you've contacted me over email or I know you before hand.
