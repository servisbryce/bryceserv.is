# Loosening the earth.
If we even wish to consider doing anything with this land, we must loosen up the soil. This patch of land has completely dried because there wasn't any vegetation covering the soil underneath, thus leading to the ground drying out and becoming even more inhospitable to life. I used a twist tiller in a grid pattern across the entire patch of the land to loosen up the soil so we could remove a layer of topsoil and replace it with more hospitable earth. After about an hour of tilling, the earth was finally loose enough to be shoveled.

# Removing the topsoil.
This patch of land was sprayed with potent pesticides and poisons a few years ago when it was overrun by weeds. Removing about an inch of topsoil from the loosened earth should negate any long-term effects of the poison. I could dig a few inches deeper, but that feels a bit excessive because it has been many years since the poison was sprayed. I used a shovel to dig out a few wheelbarrows of "contaminated" topsoil from the plot.

# Leveling the land.
To level the land, I used a rake to spread out the loose bottom layer of soil around to flatten it as much as possible. I'm planning on irrigating the plot soon to make it more hospitable. Overall, this project took around two to four hours, and I'm delighted with the results.
