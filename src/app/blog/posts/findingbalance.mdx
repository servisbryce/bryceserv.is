# You must balance your life, work, and hobbies as best you can.
To live well, you must balance your life, work, and hobbies to the best of your abilities. I've recently been taken away from my projects as I spend more time with friends and family as the summer season rolls around, and I have a nagging demand in my head that I should be working on my projects, but I still shouldn't. While working on projects is essential and something I love doing, I cannot let it take over my time by sacrificing other aspects of my life for it. I must balance my time. Work is the foremost priority and is a non-negotiable aspect of my schedule; however, what I do in the hours that I have is something I must balance wisely. By overprioritizing one aspect of my life, I may miss other vital elements. Simply said, you have to manage your limited time wisely, or else you might miss out. You must balance your time outside work or school wisely to spend time with friends and family while also developing your hobbies and skills.
