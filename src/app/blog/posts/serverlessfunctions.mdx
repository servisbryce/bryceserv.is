# What is a serverless function?
A serverless function is a type of application service where you are able to write and deploy applications without having to manage, configure, or create a server. These functions have are typically ephemeral and only exist for during the duration of the execution unless data is saved elsewhere.

Most commonly, these serverless functions are used for ```RESTful API``` endpoints where clients are able to interact with their favorite services through said endpoints.

# Why use serverless functions?
Serverless functions are scalable because they are easily reproducable. These functions are able to be copied over to other machines on a cloud provider and be ran almost instantly, allowing for the ability to scale up and down dynamically depending on demand.

They also simplify the management as the developer only has to worry about that function how it interacts with other infrastructure. There is no overhead where you have to deal with managing servers.

These functions are also much cheaper as you typically only pay for the compute time that your function occupies.
