# What are soft skills?
Soft skills are your ability to interact with those around you effectively and cooperatively. There is a wide variety of soft skills, from your ability to communicate your ideas to resolving conflict. Generally, any skill you'll need to work effectively in a collaborative environment with others is a soft skill.

# Why do soft skills matter?
Soft skills are necessary to promote a friendly, collaborative environment where everyone can work together to accomplish a shared goal or mission. Employers are increasingly seeking those with superb soft skills as the work landscape shifts toward a more collaborative environment built on teamwork, communication, and emotional intelligence to drive collective growth and success in the modern world. 

We're more interdependent on other people than ever, making soft skills increasingly sought after to ensure success through teamwork. The increased interdependency in modern work has and will continue to improve productivity exponentially. However, a new set of soft skills hasn't traditionally been spotlighted until recently, as we've seen the rise of collaborative work environments demand team members driven by collective success rather than individual triumphs.

You don't have to be the best at a particular trade or skill. For example, you may not be the best programmer on your team, but if you possess the soft skills to work effectively with the rest of your team, that will undoubtedly make up for it collectively. If people love working with you, then the team as a whole will grow and succeed together. Although you should not be mediocre at your trade, soft skills are more prevalent than they used to be, especially in today's work environment. Your ability to work, learn, and collaborate with others is one of the most essential skills you could have going into the market today. 

You don't have to be the best at what you do, but if people love to work with you, that makes all the difference.
