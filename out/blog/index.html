The increased interdependency in modern work has and will continue to improve productivity exponentially. However, a new set of soft skills hasn't traditionally been spotlighted until recently, as we've seen the rise of collaborative work environments demand team members driven by collective success rather than individual triumphs.\n\nYou don't have to be the best at a particular trade or skill. For example, you may not be the best programmer on your team, but if you possess the soft skills to work effectively with the rest of your team, that will undoubtedly make up for it collectively. If people love working with you, then the team as a whole will grow and succeed together. Although you should not be mediocre at your trade, soft skills are more prevalent than they used to be, especially in today's work environment. Your ability to work, learn, and collaborate with others is one of the most essential skills you could have going into the market today. \n\nYou don't have to be the best at what you do, but if people love to work with you, that makes all the difference.f:Tf02,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n# Why do you need to execute external machine code at runtime dynamically?\nI am designing a distributed computing system in which raw machine code is sent over a network for a worker peer to execute and transmit the result to the requester. The architecture in which the library file is compiled for is assumed to match the architecture of the worker peers. However, there was a significant roadblock in the development of said system: how would I dynamically run external machine code at runtime? The function signatures are to remain the same per the agreed protocol of the distributed computing system (the function signature takes a void pointer parameter and returns a void pointer parameter). I initially tried to read raw object files and execute them at runtime, which was not in the scope of my project because I soon realized I was trying to build a dynamic library loader. Thankfully, Linux has a fantastic dynamic library loader called ```dlfcn``` that does all the heavy lifting for us.\n\n# The dynamic library loader.\nThe dynamic library loader, in short, reads a ```.so``` file and disassembles it. Then, pick and prod in the library for the function name you wish to execute. The dynamic library loader will automatically pull the machine code for said function from the shared object file and make it accessible via a function call. All that's left is to perform some casting to indicate that the pointer you just pulled out of the dynamic library loader is a function you can call (you must also specify parameters).\n\nThe entire process may be summed up like this.\n```c\n/* Open the shared object file. */\nvoid *dynamic_library_context = dlopen(\"./mylibrary.so\", RTLD_LAZY);\n\n/* Create the function signature. */\nvoid *(*myfunction)(void *myfunction_vargs_p);\n\n/* Rummage through the shared object file to find a function called myfunction. \n   Then, load the machine code for that function into memory and output a pointer \n   to it. Finally, assign said pointer to the function signature we created\n   earlier so the program knows this is a function call and not just a regular pointer. */\n*(void **)(\u0026myfunction) = dlsym(dynamic_library_context, \"myfunction\");\n\n/* Call our newly created function! */\nmyfunction(NULL);\n```\n\n# What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this?\nThere are many advantages to using the dynamic library loader compared to just blatantly running machine code you found in an object file. Using the dynamic library loader isn't as janky compared to loading external object files into memory and executing them haphazardly. The dynamic library loader is a battle-tested way to manage external functions rather than trying to roll your loader. There are also some unintentional benefits to using this approach to dynamically run external code at runtime, such as increased memory efficiency and smaller binaries.\n\nHowever, some significant disadvantages make this approach undesirable to some who may opt to use just-in-time compilation as an alternative. In general, the dynamically linked loader blindly allows you to import and execute libraries without oversight. The lack of oversight makes dynamic library loading extremely powerful and modular. However, it poses a significant security vulnerability as the library may be malicious or injected with malicious machine code that could easily compromise your system. Moreover, you must explicitly define the function signatures you use in the library, as you can't readily determine what parameters a function takes by just looking at its machine code (this is why header files exist for libraries). However, a solution to this is having all your library functions input and output void pointers. These void pointers may be used to point toward any piece of data (such as a structure containing an assortment of second-layer parameters)."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"10:Tbb4,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n# What is structured data transmission?\nStructured data transmission is a way to transfer serialized data over the Internet in a structured manner. The Internet is built for data transfer; however, various protocols have limitations that must be worked around to compensate for multiple scenarios.\n\n# The maximum transfer buffer.\nThere is a maximum transfer buffer for all sockets. The maximum transfer buffer length differs between programs and protocols, but generally, the agreed-upon maximum size is sixty-four megabytes. This transfer buffer limit means you can only write data smaller than or equal in length to the buffer transfer limit.\n\n# Chunked data transfer.\nA way to get around the maximum transfer buffer is by slicing our data transmission into several sequential chunks. We evenly divide our completed data by the maximum data transfer buffer limit and then mark each chunk with what part of the sequence it is. Then, the client reconstructs and reorders the data transmission using the segments received from the peer. \n\n# Serialization.\nSerialization is storing complex objects, like structures, in a standardized manner, typically for ease of use. When transferring data, the Internet has little to no concept of data structures specific to one language. For portability and accessibility, we serialize these structures and encode their data into long strings that we can reconstruct on another machine. Serialization dramatically simplifies the transfer of structures between machines. However, there are some downsides to using serialization. Serialization is slow as it involves a lot of decoding, encoding, and translation from string to structure. Serialization also possesses substantial security overhead because you must interact with countless buffers, strings, and user-inputted data. You should generally use a trusted and battle-tested serialization library unless you are sure what you are doing. \n\n# Alternatives to serialization.\nAlternatively, if you don't want to serialize your structures, you can always write the raw memory from the structures over the Internet. You shouldn't do this because of portability concerns due to each language usually having its own unique schema for storing data. However, it is an option that is available to you. You'd need to demark the structure of the object so the program will know what structure you're trying to create. Then, you should demark the data length inserted into that structure. Lastly, after you've demarked the previous two pieces of metadata, you should append your raw data. Then, repeat for all the fields of your structure. Whenever a peer receives this data, it must first understand what kind of structure you're creating, and it will figure this out by using the demarkation you put in your transmission earlier. Then, it will find the length demarkation and then read the specified amount of bytes after that length demarker. It will repeat these last two steps for the remaining transferred data."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"11:T1189,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n# What is a dynamic thread pool compared to a static thread pool?\nA static thread pool is an effective and flexible way to parallelize any task. It has an unchanging number of threads in a structure called a pool. A program may assign functions to these pools, and a thread will elect to compute an assigned function.\n\nOn the contrary, a dynamic thread pool follows the same notion, except the number of threads in the pool may contract or expand depending on the program's priorities and preferences. A dynamic thread pool is significantly more scalable than a static one because if it becomes overloaded with tasks, it may request more threads to accommodate the increased load and then kill these threads when the load eventually decreases.\n\n# When should a dynamic thread pool be used?\nA dynamic thread pool should be used whenever the workload is unpredictable. Unpredictable workloads are typical in many types of applications, especially in applications that serve requests (servers). The ability for a thread pool to scale dynamically to accommodate an elevated but unanticipated demand is a much-preferred alternative to outright denying requests. However, there must be limits to prevent the dynamic thread pool from endlessly scaling itself up until it starts to overload the underlying operating system it's running on. Furthermore, the dynamic thread pool must also know when it's appropriate to scale down to prevent an excess of threads from accumulating that aren't going to be used.\n\n# What algorithms determine when to scale a dynamic thread pool?\nThe stepwise scheduling algorithm is a standard method for determining when and how to scale dynamic thread pools. The stepwise scheduler is a straightforward yet effective way to scale the dynamic thread pool based on existing usage data without involving complex analysis. You must set a baseline thread target, regularly telling the algorithm the number of threads it wants in the pool whenever possible. Then, you must place a maximum for how many threads may be in the dynamic thread pool. Otherwise, you risk the dynamic thread pool from scaling up too much and taking down the entire operating system. The dynamic pool may not scale more than the maximum thread target. Finally, you must set a stepwise thread amount that tells the dynamic thread pool how much it should expand whenever it is at maximum load; the stepwise thread amount should be about 10% of the thread target and remain constant. However, your needs may change depending on your application.\n\nThe stepwise scheduling algorithm assumes that whenever the thread pool is overloaded, instead of expanding the pool by the minimum amount necessary to accommodate the demand at that moment, it should overallocate the number of threads to accommodate for an increased trend in demand over a prolonged period. Stepwise scheduling is helpful for applications such as servers that often experience protracted periods of unanticipated traffic.\n\n# What are the tradeoffs for using a dynamic thread pool rather than a static thread pool?\nA static thread pool never has to worry about the performance impact of creating or killing threads, as it only has to make them once. However, when overloaded, a static thread pool is forced to deny requests rather than serve them, which leads to unreliability in your application during exceptionally high loads.\n\nFurthermore, suppose the dynamic thread pool is misconfigured. In that case, it may expand too aggressively and lead to system instability, resulting in requests being denied or the program outright crashing due to it starving from a lack of resources.\n\nHowever, a properly configured and supervised dynamic thread pool is a scalable alternative to outright denying requests and disrupting others. It's a much more favorable alternative to scale up temporarily to accommodate prolonged bursts in traffic than to turn away empty-handed users.\n\nDynamic thread pools should not be used for applications with a constant or predictable workload, such as payroll or file backup systems. However, applications that have an unpredictable workload, such as web servers or streaming platforms. The dynamic thread pool must be configured to accommodate the balancing act between stability and raw processing power. If balanced improperly, the dynamic thread pool may cause the application to become unstable and prone to crashing. However, balancing this tradeoff is easy using the abovementioned stepwise algorithm."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"12:T907,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n# Should I trust code generated by artificial intelligence?\nAbsolutely not, because artificial intelligence doesn't have the reasoning capabilities that you do. On numerous occasions, when I've experimented with artificial intelligence to see its programming capabilities, it often shipped broken, nonsensical code full of vulnerabilities and depreciated functions. You should treat all code generated by artificial intelligence as untrusted and unsafe.\n\nYou should always avoid copying code from artificial intelligence and throwing it directly into your program unless you're certain precisely what it's doing and why it's there.\n\n# What should I use artificial intelligence for?\nArtificial intelligence is exemplary at finding and recognizing patterns in data. This trait makes it incredibly good for debugging programs because it can match debugging data with its immense dataset and determine what might have happened. For example, I once encountered an extremely vague OpenSSL error, and there weren't any results on Google for it, so I couldn't figure it out and was stumped. However, when I asked artificial intelligence what the error may be caused, it provided an excellent synopsis that cleared up the vague error message and allowed me to patch the bug.\n\n# What shouldn't I use artificial intelligence for?\nDo not use artificial intelligence mindlessly. You must understand precisely what it's doing and saying because artificial intelligence cannot tell if it's saying is correct or not. Even though artificial intelligence is trained on massive datasets, you are still more intelligent than it because you can discern what is proper and what is false. You shouldn't use artificial intelligence for tasks you don't understand yourself. Instead, you should teach yourself the topic and learn it, then use artificial intelligence later as an assistant and not an expert. You should become an expert and use artificial intelligence to automate tasks that waste your time, then audit what the artificial intelligence outputs and make corrections.\n\nIn short, you shouldn't rely on artificial intelligence to be an expert for you; instead, you should use it like an assistant. You should become the expert and audit, modify, and adjust whatever outputs are spewed from the artificial intelligence model."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"13:T2cf5,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n# Which security measures should I implement?\nSeveral techniques, ranging in complexity, can strengthen the security of your virtual private server. Implementing basic security measures to harden the security of your virtual private servers will prevent most attackers from infiltrating your server. However, you may wish to implement more sophisticated security measures to thwart skilled malicious actors from trying to break into your servers.\n\nDepending on your threat model, you should implement either the baseline security measures or the baseline and advanced security measures.\n\n# Baseline Security Measures\nThese baseline security measures should be followed on any machine where applicable. They are sufficient to stop the overwhelming majority of attackers and automated malicious bots on the Internet.\n\n## Enable your firewall.\nSimply said, you need a firewall. If you have any machine facing the Internet Internet, you should always run a firewall solution on it and upstream in the network, if applicable. A firewall can effectively prevent attackers from accessing ports on your server that you did not intend to be accessible.\n\nMy favorite solution for firewalls on Linux is ```ufw```.\n\nOn Debian Linux, you can install ```ufw``` using the following command.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install ufw\n```\n\nOnce installed, allow port ``22``, the ```SSH``` default port, to prevent locking yourself out of your server. You may do so using the following command.\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow 22\n```\n\nUsing the following command, you may check which processes and ports are listening on your machine.\n\n```bash\nss -lpnt\n```\n\nEnsure that if you intend for any ports to be accessible by others on the Internet, you allow them by using the command that allows port ``` 22 ``` access.\n\nOnce you've allowed the ports you wished to be accessible by anybody on the Internet, please double-check your changes before reloading your firewall. You may do so using the following command.\n\n```bash\nufw status\n```\n\nOnce you've reviewed your firewall ruleset, you may apply them to your server using the following commands.\n\n```bash\nufw reload\nufw enable\n```\n\nCongrats, you now have a firewall protecting your server!\n\n## Stop using ```root``` as your default user!\nStop immediately if you are using ```root``` as your default user. Using ```root``` as your default user is extremely dangerous because processes running under root effectively have access to your entire server. Instead, you should create another user with ```sudo``` privileges. Whenever you need ```root``` permissions to do something, you should invoke those permissions temporarily using ```sudo```.\n\nAs ```root``` on Debian Linux, use these commands to create a new user, set their password, and grant them access to escalate privileges safely using ```sudo```.\n\n```adduser``` creates a new user on Debian Linux, designates their password, and creates their home directory.\n\n```bash\nadduser exampleuser\n```\n\nNow, grant ```exampleuser``` the ```sudo``` group which will permit them to use the ```sudo``` utility to safely escalate privileges temporarily through the shell.\n\n```bash\nusermod -a -G sudo exampleuser\n```\n\nWe're not done yet, though. Ensure that the ```sudo``` group is permitted to use ```sudo``` by checking ```/etc/sudoers```.\n\nIt's best practice to use ```visudo``` to edit ```/etc/sudoers```. However, you may use any text editor to read and/or edit the file.\n\nIf you don't see this line in your ```/etc/sudoers```, make sure you add it so ```sudo``` works! If you see the line but it's commented out, please ensure that you uncomment it so it looks exactly like the text below.\n\n```bash\n%sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL\n```\n\nYou may now switch to your newly created user using the following command.\n\n```bash\nsu exampleuser\n```\n## Hardening the Secure Shell\nAre you using password authentication to log into your server over ```SSH```? If you are, you are at a significantly high risk for automated bots trying to compromise your server by brute force your password from many different ```IP addresses```. Malicious actors often create bots that scan the Internet for servers with open ```SSH``` ports, like yours! Once they've discovered that you have an open ```SSH``` port, they will spam thousands of commonly used passwords until they get into your server. Humans are inherently flawed when generating unique, memorable, and strong passwords. Thankfully, there's a better way to authenticate yourself.\n\nThrough the power of ```SSH``` authentication keys, you can automatically log into your server remotely using the power of encryption.\n\nYou may generate a unique ```ED25519 SSH``` keypair using the command below. ```ED25519``` is regarded as one of our strongest, fastest, and most efficient elliptic curve signing algorithms available.\n\nAlso, whenever you generate this keypair, please set a password during the interactive prompt to protect your private key. Otherwise, somebody with access to your user or disks could pull your keypair and use it as if they were you!\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519\n``` \n\nNow that you've created a keypair, we must copy your public key to your server. Thankfully, ```SSH``` already has a utility for this! Use the command below to transfer your public keys to your server.\n\n```bash\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub exampleuser@yourserverip\n```\n\nAfter setting up your public key authentication on your server, try logging in.\n\n```bash\nssh exampleuser@yourserverip\n```\n\nEnter your private key decryption password if you set one. Did you notice anything different? You didn't have to enter your remote user's password. Pure magic. Now that public key authentication is working let's harden your ```SSH``` configuration.\n\nYou may use the command below to peek at your ```SSH``` configuration.\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n\nFirst, disable ```root``` logins. Since you set up a default user with ```sudo``` privileges, you shouldn't allow remote logins to ```root```. Make these exact changes to the file.\n\n```bash\n#LoginGraceTime 2m\nPermitRootLogin no\n#StrictModes yes\n```\n\nNext, explicitly enforce public key authentication. Make these exact changes.\n\n```bash\n#MaxSessions 10\n\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n```\n\nBecause of the flaws above, we should no longer use password authentication. Therefore, we will also prohibit all authentication via passwords. Make these changes.\n\n```bash\nPasswordAuthentication yes\n#PermitEmptyPasswords no\n```\n\nNow, double-check your edits to ensure that you've made them correctly. Save and close the file once you've ensured they're implemented correctly. Restart the ```SSH``` daemon.\n\n```bash\nsystemctl restart sshd\n```\n\nThen close the ```SSH``` connection.\n\nNow, log in again using the following command.\n\n```bash\nssh exampleuser@yourserverip\n```\n\nIf you set a private key, you should be prompted to type the password. Once you've decrypted it, you should be dropped into the shell on your server. If you didn't and you made a mistake, please fix it by using a ```KVM-over-IP``` solution that your hosting provider has provided you.\n\n## Change your root password.\nOn the majority of hosting platforms, they assign a randomly assigned password to your ```root``` user upon installation of your server. It's generally good practice to change this password to a unique, random, and secure password of your choice.\n\nGenerate a password using a utility like ```pwgen``` and then store it in your password manager. The longer and more random your password, the more secure it'll be.\n\nNext, escalate into your ```root``` user from your default user using this command.\n\n```bash\nsudo su\n```\n\nNow that you've escalated into your ```root``` user, execute this command to change their password.\n\n```bash\npasswd\n```\n\nThe interactive prompt will ask you to change your root password twice to ensure you've entered it correctly.\n\n### I accidentally pasted my password into the shell.\nMake sure you always understand and look at what commands you're executing. However, mistakes do happen. If you entered your password mistakenly as a command into the ```bash shell```, then this will be kept in the ```.bash_history``` file.\n\nThankfully, there's an easy utility to permanently erase this mistake from your server's disk. Run the following command.\n\n```bash\nshred --zero --remove ~/.bash_history\n```\n\nThis command will effectively permanently erase the data and make it unrecoverable by most, if not all, disk forensics software.\n\n# Advanced security measures.\nAssuming that you've completed the baseline security measures, you may want to implement more advanced security measures to stop even the most sophisticated attackers from breaking into your server. These steps aren't easy and require an extremely careful and tailored installation.\n\n## Implement service controls.\nAn extremely effective way to prevent malicious actors from breaking into your system is not only to shut the door but to also put up a privacy fence that they cannot see through or traverse. In simplest terms, an attacker can't attack you if they cannot reach the resources they need to launch their attack!\n\nThere are two effective methods of doing this.\n\n### Firewall-based service controls.\nYou may use the ```ufw``` firewall that we set up earlier to permit only certain ```IP addresses``` to connect to your servers ```SSH``` port.\n\nIf your internet service provider doesn't provide static ```IP address``` reservations to its customers, I would caution against this, as you may unintentionally lock yourself out of your server without getting back in.\n\nFirst, find all your existing ```SSH``` rules in your firewall ruleset.\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw status numbered\n```\n\nNext, delete the rule(s) you selected from your ruleset by issuing this command. Be aware that the numbers mentioned by ```ufw``` above will decrease by one every time you delete a rule if the deleted rule comes before the other rules.\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw delete X\n```\nNow, add your new rule for your ```SSH``` port in ```ufw``` to only allow your ```IP address``` to connect.\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow from yourIPv4address proto tcp to any port 22\n```\n\nCheck your firewall ruleset once again to ensure that the change you made was correct. Then, reload your firewall ruleset to rectify the changes.\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw reload\n```\n\nNow reconnect to your server over ```SSH```. The connection should've successfully gone through. However, if you made a mistake somewhere, you should use the built-in recovery console of your server through your hosting provider to revert these changes.\n\n### Creating your own intranet.\nMany hosting providers offer virtual private clouds, which are essentially shared private networks that machines can talk to each other privately on. So, hypothetically, if we add a server to this private network that has a ```Wireguard VPN``` that translates traffic from your home computer into traffic on the private network, you could log into your machines without even having these ports face the Internet. You'd have to firewall ```SSH``` to only be accessible from the private network interface on your servers.\n\nThis is an extremely complicated endeavor that I will write a guide on in another edition. However, it's the most secure, convenient, and adaptable method by far. You may also apply this to other services that you only want a few trusted people to access, such as ```IMAP``` (an email retrieval protocol).\n\nI personally use and endorse this method for those who are able to implement it correctly."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T995,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\n# Why move away from Vercel?\nVercel is an outstanding platform on which to deploy your Next web applications. However, it conflicts with my wish to start self-hosting my websites and services for digital sovereignty. Vercel is a fantastic website deployment platform, but that's about it. It's annoying and difficult to integrate with other services.\n\n## What will take Vercel's place?\nI'm replacing Vercel with virtual private servers from my favorite cloud provider, Vultr. From my personal experience over the past few years, Vultr hasn't caused me any issues other than blocking outbound traffic on ports that spammers use.\n\n# Rolling my own infrastructure.\nMy infrastructure is straightforward. I will deploy a virtual private server, statically generate my website, and upload those statically generated files to my server. I'll then host the files using ```nginx```.\n\n## Why not just reverse proxy your application instead of statically generating it and hosting it directly?\nMy application doesn't rely on fetching data and rendering it into the page because it's a blog and portfolio site. Therefore, deploying the statically generated files and hosting them directly using ```nginx``` is logically easier.\n\n# Porting my Next application for static site generation.\nI had to change Next's configuration to port my application to a static deployment environment.\n\nThe two additions were the output and image parameters. The output parameter must be set for Next to generate the necessary files for directly hosting the website, and the image parameters were required to prevent Next from making broken image requests.\n\nI then built my application and pushed the outputs straight to GitHub.\n\n# My deployment.\nOnce my virtual private server was hardened, I opened a shell on the server and pulled down the repository where my application was stored. I pointed ```nginx``` to the output directory in my pulled repository. Everything was working exceptionally well.\n\n# Update as of March 24th, 2025.\nI have somewhat dodged a bullet. Vercel and Next were hit with a critical vulnerability that permitted users to bypass middleware. Despite the critical vulnerability, it wouldn't have affected me when I was using Vercel because my web application doesn't rely on middleware for anything mission-critical.\n\nRegardless, this vulnerability didn't affect me because I self-hosted this website using static server generation on a virtual private server."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1a:[]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"0:[\"$\",\"$L7\",null,{\"buildId\":\"Cya2OdRn5jr2LOYzlOuci\",\"assetPrefix\":\"\",\"urlParts\":[\"\",\"blog\",\"\"],\"initialTree\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{}]}]},\"$undefined\",\"$undefined\",true],\"initialSeedData\":[\"\",{\"children\":[\"blog\",{\"children\":[\"__PAGE__\",{},[[\"$L8\",[\"$\",\"$L9\",null,{\"maxWidth\":\"s\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"script\",null,{\"type\":\"application/ld+json\",\"suppressHydrationWarning\":true,\"dangerouslySetInnerHTML\":{\"__html\":\"{\\\"@context\\\":\\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\\"@type\\\":\\\"Blog\\\",\\\"headline\\\":\\\"My blog.\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Read what Bryce Servis has been up to recently.\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://bryceserv.is/blog\\\",\\\"image\\\":\\\"bryceserv.is/og?title=My%20blog.\\\",\\\"author\\\":{\\\"@type\\\":\\\"Person\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Bryce Servis\\\",\\\"image\\\":{\\\"@type\\\":\\\"ImageObject\\\",\\\"url\\\":\\\"bryceserv.is/images/avatar.png\\\"}}}\"}}],[\"$\",\"$La\",null,{\"marginBottom\":\"l\",\"variant\":\"display-strong-s\",\"children\":\"My blog.\"}],[\"$\",\"$L9\",null,{\"fillWidth\":true,\"flex\":1,\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$Lb\",null,{\"columns\":\"1\",\"mobileColumns\":\"1\",\"fillWidth\":true,\"marginBottom\":\"40\",\"gap\":\"m\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"$Lc\",\"preparingthegarden\",{\"post\":{\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"Preparing the Garden\",\"publishedAt\":\"2025-04-27\",\"summary\":\"Transforming a dead dry patch of land into a garden.\",\"image\":\"/images/gallery/gardenflattened.png\",\"images\":[],\"tag\":\"Journal\",\"team\":[],\"link\":\"\"},\"slug\":\"preparingthegarden\",\"content\":\"$d\"},\"thumbnail\":true}],[\"$\",\"$Lc\",\"theimportanceofsoftskills\",{\"post\":{\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"The Importance of Soft Skills\",\"publishedAt\":\"2025-04-26\",\"summary\":\"In a collaborative work environment, those with exceptional soft skills have become increasingly saught after by employers.\",\"image\":\"/images/gallery/theimportanceofsoftskills.jpg\",\"images\":[],\"tag\":\"Journal\",\"team\":[],\"link\":\"\"},\"slug\":\"theimportanceofsoftskills\",\"content\":\"$e\"},\"thumbnail\":true}],[\"$\",\"$Lc\",\"dynamicexecutionofexternalmachinecodeatruntime\",{\"post\":{\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"Dynamic Execution of External Machine Code at Runtime\",\"publishedAt\":\"2025-04-15\",\"summary\":\"The execution of external machine code at runtime is typically a difficult endeavour.
